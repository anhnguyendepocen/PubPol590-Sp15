# 04 Group Task - CER Data Cleaning and Merging

## Background

We know there are issues with the data. We need to fix them.

The known issues can be found [**here**](http://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/).

## Set-Up

Each group should have set up a team repository. 

**For your group to receive credit for this assignment, each group must:** 

1. Add me as a collaborator to the group repository on GitHub. 
	2. Have the owner of the group repo go into the repo on GitHub.
	3. Click *Settings* on the right hand side.
	4. Under *Settings*, click on *Collaborators* on the left hand side.
	5. Please look for and add *DRNoriega*.
2. Each group must push their code to GitHub to receive credit for the assignment.
3. **NOTE:** I have *not* yet taught folks how to collaborate in groups on GitHub aka [*GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). Therefore, I *highly recommend* you work together, in-person, and have only *one* person pushing edits to the repo. Since you all have access to the repo, you will step on each others toes if you all work on the same file at the same time. This is possible once you learn how to *branch* and *merge* but that is something best learned together in class.

## Group Task

Get into your groups and accomplish the following:

1. Download all the raw data [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1srhgvqywye06a7/AACQ2j7r11wCfoY8HcpsHelfa?dl=0)
2. Import the data and clean it
3. Stack the data
4. Merge the data

Yes, this is vague. That's the point! I'll give you some hints as the class proceeds.
