# 04 Group Task - CER Data Cleaning and Merging

## Background

We know there are issues with the data. We need to fix them.

The known issues can be found [**here**](http://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/).

## Group Task

Get into your groups and accomplish the following:

1. Download all the raw data [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1srhgvqywye06a7/AACQ2j7r11wCfoY8HcpsHelfa?dl=0)
2. Import the data and clean it
3. Stack the data
4. Merge the data

Yes, this is vague. That's the point! I'll give you some hints as the class proceeds.
