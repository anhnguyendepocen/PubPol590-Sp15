## Course description

**This syllabus contains important course information. Please read it carefully.**

This course will provide an introduction to Big Data methods with applications to the analysis of energy data in order to produce actionable policy. The advent of smart technologies collecting detailed records at high frequencies on millions of consumers presents unique analytic challenges. It also provides new opportunities for understanding energy consumption, developing innovative consumer products, and designing more efficient economic policies. This course will provide a hands-on exploration of recent econometric tools for business intelligence and policy evaluation in a data-rich environment.

*__Pre-requisites:__* introductory probability and statistics; basic familiarity with scientific programming. A number of different statistics courses will satisfy the prerequisites. Familiarity with basic concepts such as random variables, sampling, conditional expectations, mean regression, linear models, multivariate models, and binary variables is required.

*The course is open to students with an adequate background. It will not assume any particular knowledge of economic theory or energy systems, although basic knowledge of economic principles will be helpful.*

##Books
A number of different books cover the econometric and statistical background for the course.
A simple introduction to Econometrics can be found in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">[**Mastering Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect**](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Metrics-Path-Cause-Effect/dp/0691152845)</span> by *Joshua Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke (Princeton, 2015)*.

A simple introduction to machine learning is available in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"> [**Learning from Data: A Short Course**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600490069)</span> by *Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail and Hsuan-Tien Lin (AML, 2012).* Another more mathematical (but free) option is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">[**An Introduction to Statistical Learning**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/book.html)</span> by *Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani*.

In addition to on-line resources it is also useful to have one or two programming references available. We highly recommend <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[**Python for Data Analysis**](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793)</span> by Wes McKinney (O’Reilley, 2013). Another option that is available for free is <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[**Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis**](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/09/Python_introduction.pdf)</span> by *Kevin Sheppard (Oxford, manuscript)*.

_Additional course readings and on-line materials will be added to reflect progress through the material. Please check each week for the latest version on Sakai._

## Course Grades
Precise definitions and requirements of the different course components will be made available in a separate document.

The letter grade for the class will be assigned at the end of the course. It is practically impossible to predict your exact letter grade after only completing a fraction of the course.

## Course Policies

**Attendance:** Class attendance is mandatory. In fact the success of this class depends to a large extent on everyone’s engagement in class teamwork. Moreover, class attendance will factor into the grade. In addition to traditional lectures, you will work in teams during class time to accomplish specific goal. If you do not attend class you will jeopardize your team’s progress. If you have to miss class for valid reasons such as medical issues you are required to provide a written note.

**Deadlines:** You will be clearly informed of all deadlines such as submitting assignments. Late submissions are not accepted. If you cannot make a deadline because of a valid reason such as an illness, you are required to provide an appropriate written note from an academic advisor or medical professional as soon as possible. You will then be offered the choice to reweigh the course grade, for example by adding more weight to Final project if you missed the deadline for submitting a required assignment. Again, please keep in mind that this may affect your team’s performance. No make-up assignments are offered. You cannot miss submitting more than two (2) assignments. Please remember that extracurricular activities or job interviews do not represent valid reasons no matter how exciting you think they are!

**Re-grade requests**: If you think there was a mistake or oversight in grading an assignment you can contact the TA within 7 days of receiving the graded assignment. You need to explain in writing which precise issue that you have identified and why you want the assignment regarded. You should keep in mind that your entire assignment will however be re-evaluated, possibly by myself, so your overall grade may go up or down as a result. An additional review may well conclude with an even stricter interpretation of the grading policy than the first one. The second decision is then final.

**Disabilities:** Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Student Disability Access Office at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations can be implemented in a timely fashion.

## Honor System

This class is subject to the [Duke Honor System](<http://integrity.duke.edu/ugrad/>).

You should be familiar with what is expected of you. Ignorance is not an excuse. Instances of academic misconduct will be reported, and subject to disciplinary action by the [Office of Student Conduct](<http://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/undergraduate-disciplinary-system>).

*Please note that if found in violation of current policies you will receive a failing grade for this class in addition to any other disciplinary action taken by the University.*

## Out of Class Discussions and Questions
You are encouraged to ask questions during class. However, outside of class, we will be using **[Piazza](https://piazza.com/)** for all class-related discussions this semester. 

The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I ask you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email <team@piazza.com>. I encourage you to check Piazza at least once a day to see the ongoing discussions and answer the questions posted by your colleagues. The best way to make sure you understand the material is by being able to explain it to one of your colleagues. The TAs and I will moderate and coordinate the discussions as well as provide or correct answers. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept—you can even do so anonymously.

Find our class page [**here**](https://piazza.com/duke/spring2015/pubpol590/home).

You are welcome to come to meet with me individually if you feel that you need to discuss an aspect of the course that you don’t feel comfortable sharing with the TA or require my intervention or attention.

## Data

We will use real data from a large Smart Metering project in Ireland. The [**Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)**](http://www.cer.ie/) is the regulator for the electricity and natural gas sectors in Ireland. The CER was first set up in 1999 and works within the framework of national and EU energy policy which aim to create a single European electricity market that best meets the needs of Europe’s energy consumers.

#### **CER Smart Metering Project**

The CER initiated the Smart Metering Project in 2007 with the purpose of undertaking trials to assess the performance of Smart Meters, their impact on consumers’ energy consumption and the economic case for a wider national rollout. It is a collaborative energy industry-wide project managed by the CER and actively involving energy industry participants including the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR), ESB Networks, Bord Gáis Networks, Electric Ireland, Bord Gáis Energy and other energy suppliers.

#### **Electricity Customer Behaviour Trial**

The Smart Metering Electricity Customer Behaviour Trials (CBTs) took place during 2009 and 2010 with over 5,000 Irish homes and businesses participating. The purpose of the trials was to assess the impact on consumer’s electricity consumption in order to inform the cost-benefit analysis for a national rollout. Electric Ireland residential and business customers, and Bord Gáis Energy business customers, who participated in the trials had an electricity smart meter installed in their homes/premises and agreed to take part in research to help establish how smart metering can help shape energy usage behaviours across a variety of demographics, lifestyles and home sizes. The trials produced positive results, the reports for which are available on from [**CER**](http://www.cer.ie/) along with further information on the Smart Metering Project.

#### **Gas Customer Behaviour Trial**

The Smart Metering Gas Customer Behaviour Trials (CBTs) took place during 2010 and 2011 with nearly 2,000 Irish homes participating.   The purpose of the trials was to assess the impact on consumer’s gas consumption in order to inform the cost-benefit analysis for a national rollout. Bord Gáis Energy residential customers who participated in the trials had a gas smart meter installed in their homes and agreed to take part in research to help establish how smart metering can help shape energy usage behaviours across a variety of demographics, lifestyles and home sizes. The trials produced positive results, the reports for which are available from [**CER**](http://www.cer.ie/) along with further information on the Smart Metering Programme.

Further information is available at the [**following link**](http://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/) and will be discussed in class.
