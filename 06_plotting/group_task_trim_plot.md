## Group Task (2/18): Time and Plot

Split up into your groups and do the following:

1. Import, stack, and merge the entire data set (like in the last group task)
2. Trim the data, keeping only *Residential Homes* that are in the *Control* or in the *Bi-Monthly Only Stimulus* and *Tariff A*.
3. Group and do a two sample t-test
4. Plot the t-values over time.
